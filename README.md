# Matplotlib-challenge
For this challenge I relied heavily on the starter code, as well as help from tutoring sessions. I had some help from a tutoring session with Mothanna Battah, as well as another tutoring session with Kourt Bailey. In particular, Kourt helped me rewrite the starter code for the for loop section in the homework. This made it much clearer and I was able to figure out the boxplot, scatter plot, and linear regression portions on my own. The most challenging part of this homework was figuring out the deduplication while preparing the data. The actual plotting of visualizations felt fairly straightforward. I was active in the Ask the Class slack channel for this week's homework, but did not need to rely on it to get the challenge completed.
